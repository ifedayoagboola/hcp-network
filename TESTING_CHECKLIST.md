## üöÄ How to Run Tests

1. **Unit Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Manual Testing:**
   - Open the application in browser
   - Go through each checklist item systematically
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Test with different browsers

3. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Use browser dev tools accessibility tab
   - Test with screen reader
   - Test keyboard-only navigation

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Use browser dev tools performance tab
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Test with large datasets
